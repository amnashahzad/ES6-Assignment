    HOISTING
  </div>
  <p>1. Create an object called `person` with a `name` property and a `greet` method. The
    `greet` method should log a greeting message with the person's name.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="greet()">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="varOutput"></p>

  <p>2. Create a constructor function called `Car` that has `brand` and `speed` properties.
    Add a method called `accelerate` that increases the speed of the car by a given
    value. Add a method called `print Speed` that logs the current speed of the car.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="Car">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="letOutput"></p>

  <p>3. Create an object called `calculator` with a `value` property and three methods: `add`,
    `subtract`, and `multiply`. Each method should take a number as a parameter and
    update the `value` property accordingly. Add a method called `printValue` that logs
    the current value.</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="calculator">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="constOutput"></p>

  <p>4. Imagine you have an object called book with properties like title, author, and pages.
    How would you define a method called printInfo that logs a message displaying the
    book's title, author, and number of pages using this keyword?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="book">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="undeclaredOutput"></p>

  <p>5. You have a constructor function called Person that creates person objects with
    properties like name and age. How would you define a method called introduce that
    logs a greeting message including the person's name and age, using this keyword?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="Person()">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="functionOutput"></p>

  <p>6. Consider an object called counter with a property count and two methods:
    increment and reset. How would you define the increment method so that it
    increases the count property by 1 using this keyword?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="counter">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="functionOutput"></p>

  <p>7. Let's say you have an object called product with properties like name, price, and
    discount. How would you define a method called calculateDiscountedPrice that
    calculates and returns the discounted price of the product using this keyword?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="product">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="functionOutput"></p>

  <p>8. Imagine you have a function called play which is defined inside an object called
    game. How would you call the play function from within the object using this
    keyword?</p>
  <button class="btn btn-light" onclick="game">Click to execute</button>
  <p id="functionOutput"></p>
